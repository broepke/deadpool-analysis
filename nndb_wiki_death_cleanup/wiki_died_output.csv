He did not want to compromise with his domestic enemies and wanted to prove to Mexico's elite and American interests that he was the only viable alternative to anarchy and radicalism. In March 1919, General González ordered his subordinate Guajardo to attack the Zapatistas, but when González discovered Guajardo in a cantina, he had him arrested. Zapata attempted to send a note to Guajardo inviting him to switch sides, but the note ended up in González's hands. González used this note to his advantage, accusing Guajardo of being a traitor and reducing him to tears. González convinced Guajardo to feign a defection to Zapata to recover from the disgrace. Guajardo and Zapata corresponded and planned a mutiny. On April 10, 1919, Guajardo invited Zapata to a meeting, but instead, he had him killed. Zapata's body was photographed, displayed publicly, and then buried. Carranza did not bring Zapata's body to the capital, but his clothing was displayed there."

The U.S. government claimed that Zarqawi received medical treatment in Baghdad, Iraq, from March to May 2002. Jordanian authorities requested his extradition from Iraq for his suspected involvement in a terrorist plot in 1999. However, reports vary on Zarqawi's location during the summer of 2002, with Jordanian court documents suggesting he trained fighters in Syria, where they allegedly killed a U.S. administrator. Some Arab intelligence sources claimed Zarqawi remained in Syria, while the U.S. contended that he was in Baghdad until November 2002, before fleeing to Iran and northeastern Iraq."

He criticized the ruling UDF government and former members of his party involved in embezzlement.

7f3be055e20d5ce6417f8c13b63f34ce,Émile_Zola,Carbon monoxide poisoning caused by blocked chimney.,"Emile Zola died on September 29, 1902 from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a poorly ventilated chimney. His funeral was attended by thousands, including Alfred Dreyfus. Zola had just completed a novel about the Dreyfus trial, and a sequel was planned but never finished. Some blamed Zola's enemies for his death, but it could not be proven at the time. Many people expressed sympathy and visited Zola's house to pay their respects. However, his enemies celebrated his death. Henri Rochefort claimed that Zola had committed suicide after discovering Dreyfus was guilty. Zola was initially buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre but was later moved to the Panthéon. During the ceremony, there was an assassination attempt on Dreyfus. In 1953, a journalist raised the possibility that Zola's death was a murder, based on claims from a pharmacist and chimney-sweep. Literary historian Alain Pagès believes that this is likely true, and Zola's great-granddaughters corroborate this explanation."

7fed2ec67fd50baaad935155735b9fda,Huldrych_Zwingli,Death in battle.,"After the failure of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli focused on forming alliances with Philip of Hesse. He negotiated with several cities and countries, but had little success. Meanwhile, Charles V invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views on faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession, while cities like Strasbourg and Constance presented the Tetrapolitan Confession. Zwingli produced his own confession, Fidei ratio, which was strongly anti-Catholic and anti-Lutheran. When Philip of Hesse formed the Schmalkaldic League, some cities joined based on a Lutheran interpretation of the Tetrapolitan Confession. Zürich, Basel, and Bern considered joining, but Zwingli couldn't reconcile the confession with his beliefs and severed relations with the League. The Burgrecht cities faced conflicts with the Five States and attempted different means of applying pressure, with Zürich advocating armed conflict. In October 1531, the Five States declared war on Zürich. Zürich's mobilization was slow and they suffered a defeat in the Battle of Kappel, where Zwingli was among the casualties. He was seen by Luther and Erasmus as a threat to their beliefs, and his death was viewed as a judgment from God."

The Spirits Act of 1860 allowed for the blending of grain whiskies with malt whiskies, leading to the rise of blended Scotch whisky, which was lighter and sweeter and appealed to a wider audience. Alec Walker introduced the brand's square bottle in 1860, making it more convenient for storage and transportation. The label was also placed at an angle of 24 degrees upwards left to right, making it more visible and recognizable from a distance. The arrival of a railway in Kilmarnock, where the brand was produced, boosted sales as it facilitated the transportation of goods to merchant ships. Alec created Johnnie Walker's first commercial blend in 1865 and named it Old Highland Whisky. By the time Alexander Walker II inherited the company, whisky sales accounted for a significant portion of the firm's income."

Walker's body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony. A documentary about his life titled I Am Paul Walker was released in 2018."

854902657e324d80d7ca3f7489328c96,Raoul_Wallenberg,Unknown,"This text discusses the various evidence and testimonies surrounding the fate of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II. On 6 February 1957, the Soviet government released a document stating that Wallenberg had died in his prison cell in 1947, potentially due to a heart attack. However, there have been conflicting reports and theories about his death. In 1991, an investigation concluded that Wallenberg was executed in Lubyanka prison, possibly through poison. In 2000, a statement by Alexander Yakovlev, a former Soviet official, claimed that Wallenberg had been shot. Additional evidence supporting his execution came to light in 2016 with the discovery of KGB head Ivan Serov's diary. Despite the new information, Wallenberg was posthumously rehabilitated in 2000 by the Russian prosecutor. His personal belongings were returned to his family in 1989, and files related to his case were given to the Russian government in 2007. These items are now displayed at the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow."

Initially skeptical of the role of women as propagandists, she was convinced by her friends to use her talents for the patriot cause. Her writings were influenced by contemporary literature and sought to provide moral lessons. While not read for factual details, her works are considered valuable in understanding the mood of the Revolutionary era and early nation. Debate exists among feminists regarding her inclusion in their movement, as she held traditional views on women's roles but also encouraged women writers. Despite her desire to retire from political commentary, the public continued to seek her opinions. Mercy Warren was honored by having a Liberty ship named after her and being inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Her great-great-grandson, Charles Warren, went on to become a notable lawyer and historian."

The exact cause of her death is debated, with some suggesting it was an act of solidarity with war victims and others attributing it to her study of Arthur Schopenhauer's teachings on self-starvation. However, one biographer believes the coroner's report was mistaken and claims that Weil asked for food during her time in the hospital. Another biographer suggests that her death was a result of her compassion for the suffering in France and her deep devotion to Christ. Ultimately, her death is seen as an act of love."

Williams had expressed in his will that he wanted to be cremated and have his ashes scattered in the Florida Keys.

Eventually, the elder daughter dropped her lawsuit on the condition that a trust fund left by Williams be equally distributed among the three children.

During this time, De Witt, the Grand Pensionary, was severely wounded by an assassin and resigned from his position. His brother Cornelis, who was arrested on false charges of treason, was tortured and sentenced to exile. Both brothers were later attacked and killed by the Orangist mob. The lynching of the De Witts further fueled mob attacks and led to the empowerment of William, who was granted the authority to restore public order by purging city councils. The purges were accompanied by peaceful Orangist demonstrations that demanded the restoration of guild and civic militia privileges, greater influence for Calvinist preachers, and a roll-back on the toleration of Catholics and dissenting denominations. The new Orangist regime of William was well-established during his reign, although his exact role in the murder of the De Witt brothers remains uncertain. The political turmoil prevented the allies from finishing off the Republic, as the French were hindered by the water defenses and their incursion on frozen inundations almost ended in disaster. The States General managed to form alliances with the German emperor and Brandenburg, which relieved the French pressure in the East."

Four of his former students, including Elizabeth Anscombe and Yorick Smythies, were with him during his final moments. At Wittgenstein's request, a Dominican friar named Father Conrad Pepler attended his bedside. Wittgenstein was given a Catholic burial in Cambridge.

He began work on his autobiography in 1962 and wrote his final fiction, ""Basil Seal Rides Again."" This book was regarded as ""nasty."" However, in the same year, he received the title Companion of Literature from the Royal Society of Literature. His autobiography, ""A Little Learning,"" was published in 1964, and he wrote appreciatively about Pope John XXIII upon his death in 1963.

6b4a624d71f4dcfb1528a97df611d908,Jackie_Wilson,Pneumonia,"On September 29, 1975, Jackie Wilson suffered a massive heart attack while performing on stage. Audience members initially thought it was part of the act, but Dick Clark realized something was wrong and stopped the music. Cornell Gunter of the Coasters resuscitated Wilson, who was then rushed to the hospital. Wilson had a habit of sweating profusely during performances, and would consume a large amount of salt and water to induce the effect. This high salt consumption may have contributed to his heart disease. The lack of oxygen during the heart attack caused Wilson to slip into a coma, and although he briefly recovered in early 1976, he soon slipped back into a semi-comatose state. A benefit was held to raise funds for Wilson's medical expenses, with Elvis Presley covering a large portion of the bills. Wilson passed away on January 21, 1984, at the age of 49 from complications of pneumonia. He was initially buried in an unmarked grave, but in 1987, a mausoleum was purchased using funds raised by fans, and Wilson and his mother were interred there."

The autopsy showed that Wood had a blood alcohol content of 0.14% and traces of motion-sickness medication and painkillers in her system. The cause of death was ruled accidental drowning and hypothermia. However, her sister expressed doubts and claimed that Wood was terrified of water and wouldn't have left the yacht on her own. In 2011, the case was reopened after the boat captain stated that he had previously lied to the police and that Wagner was responsible for Wood's death. The investigation named Wagner as a person of interest. In 2012, the cause of death on Wood's death certificate was changed to ""drowning and other undetermined factors."" The case remains unresolved, with questions surrounding the circumstances of her death and the possibility of foul play."

Williams had a lifestyle involving drug use and abuse that led to legal trouble. In the 1970s, his drug abuse and violence began to take a toll on him. He even threatened Little Richard with a gun over a drug debt, but eventually showed compassion for his friend. This incident and other factors led to Little Richard's return to born-again Christianity. Williams was married but became estranged from his wife. He was found dead by his mother in his Los Angeles home in 1980, with a gunshot wound to the head. His death was ruled as suicide, but there were speculations that he may have been murdered due to his involvement in drugs and prostitution. No suspects were arrested or charged. Williams was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California."

He died in 1979 after fracturing his pelvis in a fall. Tiomkin composed close to a rate of one film per month in the 1950s and was the highest-paid film composer of that time. He composed 57 film scores between 1948 and 1958, and his most famous work includes the scores for films like High Noon, for which he won two Academy Awards. He was honored in the Soviet Union and Russia and served as a jury member at the Moscow International Film Festival in 1967. Tiomkin was the first film score composer to write both the theme song and the score. His use of theme songs in many of his films had a significant impact on Hollywood in the following decades. Tiomkin's work often included ""source music"" that was believed to be influenced by Russian folk songs, and he was known for creating grand American theme music by combining the styles of European classical composers and American folk music. Some of his film scores were released on LP soundtrack albums, and he has been recognized by the US Postal Service with a stamp in their ""Hollywood Composers"" series.

bbb36c411d35528f695bfcdc2f537643,Rudolf_Steiner,Rudolf Steiner - Cause of death: illness,"This text discusses the relationship between Rudolf Steiner, founder of anthroposophy, and the Nazi regime in Germany. It mentions that Steiner was attacked by members of the National Socialist German Workers Party, who accused him of being a tool of the Jews. Steiner warned against the disastrous effects of the Nazis coming to power, and he faced threats and disruptions in his lectures. After his death, there were attacks on his thought and anthroposophy by Nazi leaders, who criticized his ideology as incompatible with Nazi racial ideology. However, there were also supporters of anthroposophy within the Nazi regime, including Rudolf Hess, who was a patron of anthroposophy and defender of Steiner's biodynamic agriculture. Overall, the relationship between anthroposophy and the Nazi regime was complex, with some factions opposing it and others allowing it to exist."

This was largely due to the publication of a book by Barry Lynes in 1987, which claimed that Rife had successfully cured cancer but that his work was suppressed by a conspiracy led by the American Medical Association. The American Cancer Society dismisses these claims as implausible and criticizes the book for its style and lack of verifiable evidence. After the book's publication, various devices bearing Rife's name were marketed as cures for cancer and other diseases. However, these devices were found to be ineffective and often sold with grandiose claims. In some cases, cancer patients who used these devices instead of conventional therapy died. There have been several cases of health fraud and convictions related to the sale of Rife devices. Rife machines are now considered pseudomedicine by mainstream experts and their use has been blamed for the deaths of cancer patients in Australia."

The resurrection is not a return to earthly life but signifies God the Father's affirmation of all that Jesus taught and represented. It is through the resurrection that Jesus is vindicated and established as the absolute Savior. His life and death are seen as the cause of God's salvific will, opening the door to our salvation. Jesus of Nazareth is thus understood as the God-Man, the ultimate savior."

Her work gave her insight into the struggles of women in the region, further reinforcing her belief in the need for women's suffrage. She was elected to the Manchester School Board and reopened her store for extra income. The Pankhurst children all became involved in the suffrage movement, with Christabel becoming her mother's favorite and eventually joining her in speaking events. Sylvia pursued art studies, while the younger children, Adela and Harry, faced difficulties in their studies."

4ef3362ba787da22ea03d6d2914cb4ca,John_Steinbeck,John Steinbeck died from heart disease and congestive heart failure during the 1968 flu pandemic.,"John Steinbeck, the American author, died on December 20, 1968, at the age of 66 in New York City. He died from heart disease and congestive heart failure, which was exacerbated by his lifelong smoking habit. An autopsy revealed that his main coronary arteries were almost completely blocked. Steinbeck's body was cremated and interred in Salinas, California, alongside his parents and maternal grandparents. His third wife, Elaine, was also buried there in 2004. Before his death, Steinbeck expressed belief that his physical death would be the final end to his life. In 1976, his incomplete novel based on King Arthur legends, called The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights, was published. Many of Steinbeck's works are required reading in American high schools, although some have faced controversy and bans due to profanity and racial slurs. The Grapes of Wrath, his most well-known novel, has been banned and burned in certain locations. Overall, Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, according to the American Library Association."

Snider had purchased a shotgun the day before and made several morbid remarks about Playmates who had died unexpectedly. Stratten had come to the house to discuss their divorce settlement and had brought cash as a down payment. Her business manager suggested she hand off the negotiations to her lawyer, but she insisted on dealing with Snider personally, saying she wanted to remain his friend. Later that evening, Snider's two roommates returned home and saw Stratten's car parked out front. Assuming the couple had reconciled, they watched television in the living room. They discovered the bodies of Stratten and Snider the next day after being alerted by Snider's private detective. Both had been killed by a single blast from Snider's shotgun, and their bodies were found nude. It is believed that Snider shot Stratten shortly after her arrival and then committed suicide about an hour later. Stratten's death was devastating to her friends and family, and she was buried in Los Angeles with an epitaph chosen by her boyfriend, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. Three years later, Mariel Hemingway played Stratten in a biopic about her life."

In the 1940s and 1950s, English professors moved away from Parrington's approach and focused more on the texts themselves rather than the social and political contexts that interested him. Historians also shifted to a consensus model of the past, considering Parrington's liberal and conservative views to be naive. During the 1950s, his book lost popularity and scholars ignored it. However, some still admired Parrington's politically committed writing style. The Parrington Oval at the University of Oklahoma and Parrington Hall at the University of Washington are named after Parrington."

ffafd8b75606bd0303c555566af3f5cb,Ruben_Salazar,Cause of death: Shot with tear gas projectile.,"Ruben Salazar, a prominent member of the Los Angeles Chicano community, was killed on August 29, 1970, during the National Chicano Moratorium March protesting the Vietnam War. Salazar was resting in a bar when he was struck in the head by a tear gas round fired by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The incident sparked panic and rioting. Although an inquest ruled the shooting as ""death at the hands of another,"" the deputy responsible was never prosecuted. Many believed it was a premeditated assassination. The riots started when a fight broke out between deputies and people stealing from a liquor store near the protest. Cadets from the Sheriff's Academy were also involved in a fight, leading to more rioting. Salazar's killing was covered by journalist Hunter S. Thompson in Rolling Stone magazine. A report released in 2011 stated that there was no evidence deputies intentionally targeted Salazar. However, a settlement of $700,000 was reached with Salazar's family due to the sheriff's department's improper use of force during the march. Salazar was survived by his wife and children."

7fdace08efa9fcf1bda4663998589c2a,Miguel_de_Unamuno,Inhalation of gases,"On December 31, 1936, the Spanish writer and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno died while under house arrest in Salamanca. It is believed that he inhaled gases from a brazier during a one-hour interview with a visitor. A theory presented in a 2020 book by Colette Rabaté and Jean-Claude Rabaté suggests that Unamuno may have been murdered by Bartolomé Aragón, the last person to visit him. The theory is based on Aragón falsely claiming to have been a former student of Unamuno, as well as his fascist beliefs and previous collaboration with Nationalist propaganda. However, the authors of the book did not defend this theory since there is no new evidence to support it. Nevertheless, it is known that Aragón and Unamuno had a previous intellectual relationship. Other suspicious details include the lack of an autopsy, despite the cause of death being determined as a sudden intracranial bleeding, the maid hearing two screams from Unamuno during Aragón's visit, and discrepancies in the reported time of death."

Tecumseh pleads with Procter to stay and fight, but Procter insists on retreating to Chatham. Tecumseh reluctantly agrees and leads a rearguard action at Chatham before discovering that Procter had retreated further upriver.

At the time of his death, he had an estimated net worth of $105 million. In his will, he left the majority of his estate, 95%, to his son William and four grandsons. This left his other living son and nine daughters with relatively small inheritances. Some of his children contested the will, claiming that he was not of sound mind when it was drawn up. They alleged that William and a corrupt spiritualist had influenced Vanderbilt. To avoid public humiliation, William eventually settled with his siblings, providing them with additional compensation. The will allocated varying amounts to his daughters, with his wife receiving $500,000 and their New York City home. His surviving son, whom he considered a wastrel, received income from a trust fund. Overall, the inheritances, although smaller in comparison to William's, made his daughters and Cornelius wealthy by the standards of the time and were not subject to inheritance tax."

Rappe allegedly suffered a trauma during the party and died four days later from a ruptured bladder and secondary peritonitis. The exact events of the party are unclear, with different witnesses giving varying accounts. Some alleged that Rappe died as a result of a violent sexual assault by Arbuckle, but his accuser had a criminal record for extortion and prostitution. Other witnesses testified that Rappe had pre-existing health conditions such as cystitis and venereal disease, suggesting that her death may have been caused by her health rather than an assault. Arbuckle was tried for manslaughter three times and was eventually acquitted, but his reputation and career were ruined as a result of the scandal."

He argued for capital punishment based on the principles of deterrence and punishment for severe criminals. He believed that the primary role of government was to establish legal order and enforce laws. Van den Haag disputed the notion that capital punishment was only about retribution, stating that it was necessary to maintain legal order and justice. He also argued that making crimes as disadvantageous as possible would decrease their occurrence, using economic concepts like opportunity cost to support this idea. He related Marxist theory to his justification of the death penalty, claiming that punishment should be distributed equally among violators to deter crime. Van den Haag also believed that the death penalty was necessary for permanent incapacitation of offenders and as a way to lower the crime rate. He considered homicide to be the most deplorable crime and argued that capital punishment could decrease murders. He rejected rehabilitation as a response to those who commit murder, stating that it is ineffective and only works after the crime has occurred. Overall, van den Haag believed the death penalty should exist to protect innocent lives, even though he recognized the risk of executing innocent people."
